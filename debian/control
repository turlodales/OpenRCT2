Description: An open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.
 OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2,
 expanding the game with new features, fixing bugs and raising game limits.
 The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park
 containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a
 profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy.
 .
 OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the
 player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox
 allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no
 restrictions or finance.
